# NAME

rmsilence - remove silent parts from specified video files

# DESCRIPTION

**rmsilence** is a Perl script for automatically removing silent parts (video
segemnts with silent audio tracks) from video files.  For every video file
specifed as command-line arguments, **rmsilence** uses the **silentdetect**
audio filter in FFmpeg for detecting silent parts in a video file.  Non-silent
parts are extracted from the original video files, and those files are
concatenated as a single video file.  All video files without silent parts are
stored in the output directoary (/tmp by default).  You can specify the output
directoary with -d option.

# REQUIREMENTS
